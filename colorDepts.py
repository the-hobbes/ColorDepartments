'''
	Your goal is to color a map of these regions with two requirements: 
	1) make sure that each adjacent department do not share a color, so you can clearly distinguish each 
	department, and 
	2) minimize these numbers of colors.
	
	The input will be a variation of the list of French departments, represented as an adjacency list[5] . This challenge is essentially solving for Graph coloring[6] , where 
	you must print each department's color (a unique integer).

	Input Description:
		On standard console input, you will be given an integer N which represents the following N-lines of an adjacency list. These lines of data will always be in the format 
		of integers A B C D ... where A is the source node / vertex that points to vertices B C D... etc. Remember that this data really means that A is the ID of a department, 
		and B C D ... are the bordering departments.
		Writing up the French department list as an adjacency list is very tedious; feel free to only work on a subset.
	Output Description:
		For each given node (a department), print the unique color identifier after it. A color identifier is unique integer, starting from 0, that represents a unique color. 
		Remember that bordering departments (e.g. adjacent nodes) cannot have the same color index!
